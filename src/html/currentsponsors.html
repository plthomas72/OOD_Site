			 		Opportunity on Deck is a non-profit organization which provides organized athletics to disadvantaged Iowa youth. The goals of the organization are: to share organized athletics with those who can't afford to participate in traditional leagues, to build a sense of community among the participants and their families, to instill the values of teamwork and hard work among the young ballplayers, and to provide the participants with positive role model coaches. In the three years since Opportunity on Deck was created we've helped teach more than 300 children how to play baseball and basketball. The leagues and clinics have received recognition and support from the honorable Tom Latham in the United States House of Representatives, Governor Terry Branstad, Drake University, the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library, Prudential, Bankers Trust, NCMIC, and the Iowa Cubs among others. During the summer of 2013 I had the opportunity to focus on the development of Opportunity on Deck, specifically focusing on ways to expand the organization's community impact, through Drake University Entrepreneurship Center's Lorentzen New Venture Hatchery program. Through this program, Opportunity on Deck expanded the number of leagues and participation by four times, and developed relationships with Clive and Des Moines Parks and Recreation, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Iowa, and Oakridge Neighborhood.
